# spacemaster
> spacemaster is born to handle computer screen space related queries

## What it is/does
It reads screen space query and try its best to answer/compute.
Even though spacemaster is trying to be general and independent of [Keytty](https://keytty.com), still the main purpose of this program/library is to complement Keytty

## Status
At the moment this is not being used for Keytty yet but it will be in the future.

## Roadmap

- [ ] optional percentage delta
- [ ] relative position for different size screen
- [ ] _maybe_ reverse y position for bottom zero screen like mac
